ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Christian

~ I've had a passion for software engineering and artificial intelligence since a very young age, and I'm currently the CTO at M32 Development Group where I am developing full stack web applications and managing databases. Considering my premature exposure to software engineering, I'm not as much of a computer science student at ASU as I am a self-taught developer. As a result, I can easily adapt to new languages and start making contributions quickly. I'm, as well, tutoring other software engineering students to help get them started on the right foot. I am excited to further my knowledge and add more tools to my toolbox â€” hopefully turning my passion into a meaningful contribution to technology and society as a whole.

~ I would be interested in collaborating with anyone who has an ambition for software developement and will consistently contribute to the project.
