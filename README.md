ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Christian

~ I'm not as much of a computer science student at ASU as I am a self taught developer. I've had a passion for software engineering and artificial intelligence since a very young age and I am currently developing websites and web apps. I have just finished developing a few smaller games and one that I will be releasing to the app store within the upcoming months.

~ I enjoy learning new coding languages and then creating a game with it

~ I would be interested in collaborating with anyone who has an ambition for software developement and will consistently contribute to the project.
